## Project Proposal

Bus Registration System

## Project Overview

```
The bus registration system is designed to keep track of information of the
administration, customer and price.
```

## Project Description

```
The bus registration system allows only authentic registration by the only
administrators. Administrators can book seats ,modify customer record , delete
any customer record and can view the availability of seats in a particular routed
bus. It can also be used in transport organization globally.
```

## Purpose Of The Project

```
The bus registration system maintains the record each customer information
including its id, number of seats, and price. System also maintains the records of
overall daily income generated by authorized authentic administrators. This
application is widely distributed can be accessed by the administrators sitting at
particular bus terminals in different cities. In this system customers are only
allowed to access or look for the availability of seats in a particular bus of a
particular rout at terminal.
```

## Problems In The Existing System

```
The existing system handles variety of DBMS problems and tries to deviate from
the flaws like data redundancy, safety, security, data inconsistency, data isolation,
atomicity and difficulty in accessing data. The existing system aims to provide the
usable and well managed and structured interface for administrator, customer
and its prices of particular bus. Administrator users can view and manipulate the
data for which it is responsible. For each it must allow the rapid formulation and
resolution of queries related to the customer information. Moreover, this system
objects to maintains the data consistency, integrity and its security by the help of
certain database operations and domain constraints.
```

## Solutions of This Problems

```
The construction of this new system encircle the following activities, which try to
automate the entire process with respect to the view of database integration
approach.
• System retains the backup of data in case of any system failure.
• System provides rich user interface which provide ease of access to the users, 
  and maintains user friendliness through interactive tools in a system.
• The system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.
• The student information can be stored in centralized database which can be maintained by the system.
• System maintains data security and guarantees its safety.
• Authentication is provided for this project through which only certain enrolled /registered 
  bus administrator can access and manipulate data,
• while customers are only allowed to view the data but are not authorized to manipulate it.
• Administrator can rollback or retrieve the previous data from the stored backup database.
